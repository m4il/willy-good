    Kick out my crutches, and I will learn to walk again

    <p>
    On my third day in the Netherlands I rented a bike. Funny enough, I was able to find a 1993 Giant x2000 (for 10 euros a day!). Cromoly steel, lugged fork, tire clearance for 700X46… I’ve been trying to find myself one of these in the states for a year or two now. At the end of the trip I actually considered trying to buy this very bike, but the thought of shipping a mass-produced bike that’s older than I am felt a bit ridiculous, even for me.
    </p>
    <p>
    Bright eyed and bushy tailed on my newly found dream-bike, I embarked on a 70km round-trip bike ride which wove me through the Dutch countryside and a national park, before depositing me at the North Sea. The journey to the sea was every bit as lovely as I imagined, Naturally, I missed turns, but the number of bike-friendly paths seemed endless, and my trusty phone effortlessly re-routed me. When I arrived at the beach, I dipped my toes into the frigid north sea. An hour of a magnificent biking high, followed by a natural ice bath for my feet — perfection!
    </p>
    <p>
    After soaking up some sun, I embarked on the journey home. As was true on my outbound journey, I routinely missed turns. I actually passed this older couple on a tandem touring bike 2 or 3 times because my directional mishaps would result in them passing me, then me catching back up to them. I cant help but wonder what they thought of me, a silly directionless tourist!
    </p>
    <p>
    At one point, I took a wrong turn and found myself on a new path. This time, out of fear that I would be yet again judged by the tandem tourers, I decided not to turn back. I believed this path (despite google maps’s doubts) would link back to the main path. I reached the point where a left turn should have deposited me nicely onto the correct path, but I was saddened to see a narrow, sandy trail littered with tree roots and a wooden staircase off in the distance. Faced with the choice of carrying my bike for who-knows-how-long, and doubling back, I chose to turn around. The bitter taste of my ego slowed my pace.
    </p>
    <p>
    From this point on, I chose to follow google maps more strictly. I was rewarded for my obedience. Grassy hills with littered with long hair bulls, whose horns are as long as I am tall. I emerged from the national park and crossed a river–not another soul in sight. I enjoyed my time crossing the dutch countryside, and stopped to feed some baby sheep that looked to be born the day prior. I took my phone out of its carrier to take some pictures, and check in on my progress home. My battery was at 27%. I did some quick maths, and figured if I biked quick, I could make it the remaining 1.5 hours back with some charge to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
    About thirty minutes later, I found myself on a beautiful little bridge so I stopped to take some photos on my film camera. 6%. I got that sinking feeling in my stomach. I started to sweat. Closed all apps except maps, brightness down, airplane mode, maybe I’ll make it. I decided to study my map a bit closer just to orient myself if IT happens. My decision to take the weave-y, scenic route home was biting me in the butt. This would most certainly be way too many turns to memorize. I took a deep breath and off I went, cycling way harder than I could realistically sustain for the remaining hour of my journey back. The anxiety of a dead phone in the dutch countryside just about doubled my heart-rate.
    </p>
    <p>
    I tried to keep a level head, but the dread of my phone dying only made me check it more often. For a moment I thought 1% was going to get me home. I pulled over one last time to have some water and study my path home. Then it happened. An hour of anxiety, dread, and denial couldn’t save the inevitable. My phone died, and I was now on my own. Map-less in the dutch countryside.
    Five minutes later, with my digital lifeline demoted to a useless brick, I felt a sense of calm. No longer did my draining battery also drain me. I could breathe again. In the void of dread, I was filled with excitement. I decided this would be a fun challenge. I slowed my pace and took careful note of where the sun was in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some time later, I saw some other cyclists ahead of me. I asked one if I was headed in the right direction, and he kindly lead me for 15-20 minutes, before going his separate way. Soon I saw a sign with an arrow that said “Amsterdam”. Alas, I would be okay.
    </p>
    <p>
    Looking back, I can’t help but laugh at irony in my earlier decision to ignore google maps. That detour cost me about 40 minutes, which would have left me with just enough battery to get home. Why was I falsely empowered to ignore my map in a country I had never been to before? I am now realizing, with some help from a self proclaimed AI-hater from Berlin who I met at the AIxDesign festival, that Amsterdam and the Netherlands are curated for me, a white and blonde westerner, who likely has a hint of dutch heritage, at the top of the food chain. Yes, their bike lanes, canals, and walkable streets feel human-centric to many others who don’t fit into the same ethnic bucket as me. However, I am precisely the person who can go off on a bike ride and not care if their phone dies, confident that whoever finds me will lead me home.

    This positionally is precisely what allowed me to travel to some of the most remote islands in the world last August on a surf-tourism trip to Indonesia. Again without help from Google maps, I relied on chartered boats and hired drivers, to travel huge distances across the archipelago of Indonesia — traveling further in a day than most Indonesians will ever get to in their lifetime. The hours were long, but everyone we met along the way was eager to help. I always felt safe. My travels throughout Indonesia were made possible through the kind, humorous, and curious Indonesians who held my hand along the way. Unable to discern between the kindness of Indonesian culture and remnants of Dutch colonial caste, I keep returning back to the same feeling of undeserving comfort and passport privilege, knowing I can show up just about anywhere in the world, and rely on my native language to navigate.
    </p>
    <p>
    The juxtaposition of these two travels, the colonized and the colonizer, shed light on some of the things I noticed in Amsterdam. The hooks used to lift spices to the upper floors of Ditch buildings, the large number of Indonesian and Surinamese restaurants, and the plethora of stolen Indonesian historical artifacts that Dutch museums hold. While in Amsterdam, the sentences that were omitted spoke the loudest. The failure to name and recognize the horrors of the dutch colonial rule were a reminder that colonialism is ongoing.

    Beyond the Bike

    Hanna and I spent the first few days in Amsterdam being tourists. A weeklong stint of beautiful weather swept across the city, arriving the same day we did. The parks were full of sunbathers, birthday parties, and picnics. The energy was undeniable, and Hanna and I fell in love with De Pijp, the neighborhood we chose to stay in. We filled our days with second-hand shopping and pastries from our respective favorite bakeries (which were just a block away from each other). We also went to the Kuekenhoff gardens to see the tulips (think Disneyland meets botanical gardens) which unexpectedly took my breath away.
    </p>
    <p>
    Amsterdam truly left me with so many lovely human experiences. I helped an elderly couple push their stalled car out of an intersection. We also met a man whose best friend just moved from Amsterdam to Berkeley, and we’re delivering a book from the NL to his friend in Berkeley! Hanna and even I found an adorable little gluten free bakery, and the woman who owned it kindly showed me her recipe for a gluten free baguette, my next new challenge!
    </p>
    <p>
    We wrapped up the trip with a wonderful festival put on by AIxDesign, a collective of artists and researchers, who curated three days of talks and workshops on slow AI. A challenge to the typical “build fast, break things” rhetoric that indoctrinates much of Silicon Valley. Among the speakers was Hanna, who gave a beautiful talk on the subject of AI narratives, followed by a workshop where we used collage to re-write our own narrative of AI. I initially joined as Hanna’s plus-one, but as the festival went on, I found new friends and built relationships with artists, computer scientists, and researchers who I found so so inspiring! On top of these new potential friendships, it was so magical to see Hanna in her element, eloquently commanding a room while everyone nods intently at the connections she makes between manifest destiny and techno-optimism. People snapped photos of her slides, and came up to her after to pick her brain about the talk. Damn, she’s smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I return to the land of toxic water and toxic-er tech bros, I can’t help but be thankful for a fully-charged phone battery. The bike journeys, the festival, and the reflections really made a beautiful week. Amsterdam welcomed us with open arms, and I look forward to visiting again soon.
