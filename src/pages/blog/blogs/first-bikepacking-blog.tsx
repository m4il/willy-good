    </h5>
    <p>
      On my 26th Birthday, Hanna and Geiereann asked what I wanted to accomplish this year, and one of the things I mentioned is that I wanted to go bikepacking.
      Not long after, Geierann came across a one-night bikepacking route that we could start from our apartment in San Francisco. Neither one of us had ever been bikepacking before,
      but this route seemed perfect. We could leave directly from our apartment, and spend most of the trip close to home in areas we're familiar with.
    </p>
    <p>
      We put a date on the calendar and decided to do it.
      Day one crosses the Golden Gate Bridge, winds through the Marin Headlands, over Mount Tamalpais, and finally down into Samuel P Taylor State Park, where there is a bike-friendly campsite.
      Day two travels through the same areas in reverse direction, on different trails. All in, the route would be about 80 miles of gravel, road, and mountain bike trails, with over 9,000 feet of elevation gain.
    </p>

      Saturday morning, Geireann and I loaded up our bikes and departed from our garage in San Francisco. As you can probably tell, we didn't have much of the right gear.
      Channeling the "just go" mindset, we used what had. My basket was loaded way past its limit and our gear was secured to our racks with hammock straps and tie downs. We had what we needed -- sleeping bags
      and a tent, food, water, and tools. What could go wrong?
    </p>

    <p>After crossing Golden Gate Bridge, we hung a hard left and climbed Hawk Hill. We've both biked Hawk Hill many times before, but never with this much gear.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Half way up our final climb of the day, I started to cramp. We found a shady oasis in an oak grove and chugged electrolytes. I was a little nervous about the amount of riding that we still had, but remembered that we brought gummy worms. Without them, I would not have been able to continue.</p>

    </div>
    <p>We stopped for a second lunch just as the path switched from gravel to road, then embarked on the final push up this 2500ft climb. As we neared the top, Geierann and I gained some steam. We were on top of the world! I looked back to Geireann and said something overly confident, how proud I was of my little bike. Not 30 seconds later, I hit something huge and my bike stopped in its tracks. My back wheel popped up and I nearly went over my handlebars. Turns out, the bracket I used to attach my basket to my fork snapped, and I ran over my basket. I'm Icarus, I thought to myself. I flew too close to the sun.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Geireann was certain we were cooked. Luckily, I had thrown some extra basket brackets in my seat bag a few months back, and never took them out. In less than 10 minutes, my trusty Wald basket was back in action! </p>

    </div>
    <p>We summited Mt Tamalpais and began the beatiful descent down Bolinas Ridge Trail. 11 Miles of beatiful descending is all that stood between us and the campsite.</p>
    <div className="blog-photos-bikepacking">

      <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/blog/bikepacking/IMG_3791.jpeg'} alt={'cow road'}  />
    </div>
    <p>The second half of the trail was pretty darn bumpy, and our gear started to fail us. For about five miles we stopped every ten minutes to fix something. The road was so bumpy that the bolts holding my rack on my bike were constantly being unscrewed! Despite the hiccups, our spirits remained high. Camp was close, and the views were divine! </p>

    </div>
    <p>We rounded a corner and made it to pavement. I cannot even begin to describe how unbelievably smooth it felt! My bones were shaken and my hands were weak from squeezing my brakes so hard. We rolled into a packed campground just moments before dusk. Samuel P. Taylor campground is really beautiful, but it was comedic how little space they allocated to the bikepacking campsite! The site was a little tight, but the other campers were super nice, and eager to hear about our day. We roasted some sausages over the fire, crushed a box of Tim Tams, and hit the hay. The next day would be another long day of riding!</p>

    </div>
    <p>We decided to take the second day slow, and ride pavement for the steep inclines instead of gravel. We finished a big climb, and rested for a little at Lake Lagunitas, how beautiful! I really wanted to swim, but apparently only ducks were allowed to (it's a reservoir).</p>

    <p>The final climb (or so we thought) of day two! These sandwiches we bought from a market in Fairfax had wayyyyy too much spicy mustard!</p>

    <p>The ride home on GGB was the windiest I've ever ridden! Add in all the gear, a few near misses between tourists on city bikes, and it was quite entertaining!</p>

    </div>
    <p>Back where we started! Such a wonderful trip with one of my best friends. A successful first (of many) bikepacking trip in the books, I couldn't have asked for it to go any other way.</p>
