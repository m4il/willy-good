    <p>At the end of July, Hanna and I packed up both of our apartments, and loaded up a U-Haul to migrate north to Seattle. It was so hard saying goodbye to Geireann, ocean beach, golden gate park, and the saturday pickup soccer commumity at mission rec. Hanna and I planned to split the drive into two days, with a stop in grants pass, oregeon. I drove the uhaul, which towed hannas prius behind it, and hanna drove my subaru. At the end of the first day, about 20 miles south of the hotel, the uhaul spewwed gas all over the ground. After an evening on hold, we went to bed thinking we may not make it to seattle in this truck. Luckily, we woke up the next day to a call from a mechanic, saying he had already fixed the car. Godsend. Through this experience we learned that I am indeed a pushover. Thanks to hanna, we were able to get refuded for almost the whole uhaul rental and the hotel! Worth it.</p>
    <p>We arrived in Seattle with a literal truckload of shit, and unpacked our stuff on hyperspeed. Because hanna and I are both absolutely crazy, the following saturday we decided to go hiking on mount ranier. We were blessed with a sunny day, and we frolicked through the berry-filled forests, taking in views of the monstrous glacier. I never expected the mouintain to look so grotesque, and feel to powerful. Shiny patches of brownish white melting snow and ice, polka dotted by granite (fact check) rock features almost encorached my personal space. The whole experience was surreal, and we spent hours hunting berries on the way home.</p>
    <p>Growing up in southern california, I never really appreciated the summer weather all that much. People comain about june-gloom, a phenomenon where the pacific ocean deposits grey skies up and down the west coast of california, right as school gets out. Other than that, I took the sun for granted. San Francisco, on the other hand, experiences "summer" some time between sepember and november. May through August are cold and gloomy, with fog so thick you need a raincoat.</p>


    <p>These days I have two bikes, both barters, both bargains. For the full-suspension bike, I traded a loaf of home-made sourdough bread and a bottle of olive oil. For the second, an estate sale recovered frame, and my perfectly broken-in brooks saddle.</p>
    <p>
      While living in San Francisco, I was a proud owner of four bikes, all but one of which were manufactured before I was born. Each had their own quirks -- some dropping chains, others jumping gears, and one which refused to stop. These problems were self-manufactured. I could take my bikes to a mechanic, where they would berate me about mixing SRAM + Shimano drivetrain parts, or using cantilever brakes with long-pull brake levers, but where's the fun in that? Instead, I prided myself in peddaling my 30 pound hunks of steel passed kitted road bikers on plastic bikes. Each bike was built from the frame up by yours truly, and by the time I left San Francisco, other people could actually ride them too. While I loved my bikes, I also frequented the modern classifieds, Facebook Marketplace, in search of a good deal on a surly bike. I found some deals, but could never justify another bike, especially a nice one.

      At the end of July, Hanna and I packed up both of our apartments, and loaded up a U-Haul to migrate north to Seattle. In the weeks prior to moving, I traded some sourdough bread and olive oil for a full-suspension mountain bike, bringing my total to 4 bikes. I sold two others, and brought my 1990's marin x-bike with me.
