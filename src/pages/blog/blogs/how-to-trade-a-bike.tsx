            <p>------------------------------</p>

            <p>When I moved to Seattle, I sold all my bikes except two. I kept my 90s do-anything bike and a full suspension mountain bike that I traded for a loaf of sourdough bread and a jug of olive oil (that’s a story for another day). I had full intentions of “chilling out” with my bike building obsession, but then one morning, while scrolling facebook marketplace, I came across a post for an estate sale up in Bellingham, WA. In one of the last photos of the post, I noticed a dark green Surly bike packing bike. The estate sale was right near some world class mountain bike trails, so I thought I might as well swing on by. </p>
            <p>When I arrived at the estate sale, I was relieved to see the bike still there. I took it for a short test ride, and bought the bike. When I got home, I cleaned the bike and disassembled it to clean some rust. On the bottom of the bike I saw some markings that led me to believe the bike was a XXL (HUGEEE). I didn’t even know they made those! I finished cleaning the bike without putting a whole lot of thought into it. The bike felt like it was a good size for me, so who cares!</p>
            <p>That evening, I was looking for some external validation on sizing on the internet, when I came across a Facebook post that was nearly a year old. It read something along the lines of “Does anyone have a surly ogre XXL? Surly stopped making them, and I’m too tall for an XL.” As it turns out, Surly only made XXLs for a few years, and mine was one of them. For a few hours, I contemplated responding to the post. In a spontaneous moment right before I fell asleep, I decided to respond. </p>
            <p>To my disbelief, I woke up to a response from the original poster. He’s 6’7 and there are virtually no bikes on the market that are sized to fit him. He wanted my bike. He ended up offering me a trade for one of his other bikes, another surly, with a super rad custom paint job. 24 hours ago, I didn’t even own this bike, and now I’m talking to some random dude on the internet about SHIPPING this bicycle across state lines. Absurdity! </p>
            <p>Our messenger chats spanned multiple days. Even though I was the one to reach out, I was still hesitant. Monetarily speaking, it should have been a no-brainer. His bike was newer, would fit me better, and had  nicer components. But there was a very significant chance that this whole debacle would flip upside down, leaving me bikeless (well, except for my other two bikes, but that’s beside the point!), What if he’s catfishing me? Maybe he doesn’t even own the bike he’s trying to trade me. What if this whole thing goes wrong? The ridiculousness of trading bikes with someone I’ve never met, who also lives in another state, felt too absurd to ignore. But it was exactly this absurdity that made it irresistible. I had to do it, for novelty’s sake.</p>
            <p>My internet counterpart also expressed some concerns with the situation, which somehow left me feeling more confident. Over the next few days, we ironed out the details of the trade. In an effort to “sweeten” the deal for him, we decided I would throw in my brooks leather saddle. I bought that seat two years prior, and spent my time in San Francisco breaking it in.  I convinced myself that the rainy weather in Seattle would ruin the leather, and hesitantly parted with it.</p>

            </div>
            <p>As we finalized the plans, it became more difficult to ignore the banner that reads "Do you know this person?"</p>
            <p>Shipping nice stuff to people on the internet is kinda sketchy, so we came up with a verification plan. After our bikes were disassembled, we FaceTimed while we packed the items into boxes. This was actually a hilarious moment. We ended up chatting for a good 20 minutes about biking adventures, the pacific northwest, and what we planned to do with each others’ bikes. We then took our packed bike boxes to local bike shops, where they would be picked up by the shipping company. This way, we could call each others’ bike shops to ensure at least something was getting shipped to each of us. Was the plan foolproof? Absolutely not. But it did instill a false sense of confidence in me. Enough to take this leap of fatih.</p>
            <p>After a few long days of waiting around, a massive package arrived at my doorstep. My new bike! I frantically unpacked the bike to ensure everything was there, and it was! Relief, elation, excitement. I quickly put the bike together and took it  for a few victory laps around the neighborhood. I couldn’t believe this all worked out. The following morning I took the bike for a longer ride. This bike felt fast & responsive. It was a joy to ride, and a pain in the ass to sit on. This new seat was nowhere as comfortable as my old one.</p>

            <p>I’m writing about this a few months down the line, looking back at how fun this whole experience was. Lately, my perception of the internet has been pretty pessimistic. However, this whole experience reminds me that beneath the algorithms, it’s just a bunch of humans pushing buttons. Find the right person, and you may just find yourself trading bikes through the mail. I couldn’t be happier with how it turned out, except for my seat. I still miss my seat.</p>
